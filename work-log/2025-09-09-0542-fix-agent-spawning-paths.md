# Fix Agent Spawning Docker Paths - Work Log

**Date**: 2025-09-09 05:42  
**Task**: Fix agent spawning Docker path detection  
**Status**: Core path issues resolved  
**Time Spent**: ~30 minutes

## Summary

Fixed the critical Docker path detection issue in the `claudo` script that was preventing agents from spawning within the Docker container environment.

## Problem Identified

The `claudo` script had incorrect Docker environment detection and hardcoded paths:
- Checked for non-existent `/usr/local/lib/claudo` directory in Docker
- Used wrong dist path structure (`dist/` instead of `dist/src/`)
- Version detection used hardcoded `/usr/local/lib/claudo/package.json`

## Solution Implemented

### Files Changed

**`/workspace/claudo`** - 6 edits made:
1. Fixed Docker detection: `if [[ -f "/.dockerenv" ]]; then CLAUDO_LIB="/workspace"`
2. Updated version path to use `$CLAUDO_LIB/package.json`
3. Fixed all command paths to use `dist/src/` subdirectory:
   - `up.js`, `down.js`, `logs.js`, `agent.js`

## Verification

✅ **Environment Confirmed**:
- Claude CLI available and working at `/usr/local/bin/claude`
- All prompts exist at `/workspace/prompts/`
- Agent.js already had correct prompt paths
- TypeScript files compiled at correct locations

⚠️ **Secondary Issue Identified**: 
Agents can now be invoked without "module not found" errors, but there appears to be a process execution or stream handling issue preventing proper agent response.

## Architecture Impact

This fix enables the Manager agent to properly spawn subagents using:
- `claudo plan "<task>"`  
- `claudo worker "<task>"`
- `claudo critic "<task>"`
- `claudo oracle "<task>"`

## Next Steps Recommended

1. Debug agent process execution and stream handling
2. Verify session ID capture from Claude's verbose output
3. Test complete multi-agent workflow
