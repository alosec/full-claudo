# Rename Done to Docs Directory - Implementation Complete

**Date**: 2025-09-08 09:00  
**Task**: Rename planning/done directory to planning/docs  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Time Spent**: ~30 minutes  

## Summary

Successfully renamed the `planning/done/` directory to `planning/docs/` to better represent that this is where completed features and tasks are documented as the final step from English requirements to working code.

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made

1. **Directory Rename**: 
   - Renamed `/workspace/planning/done/` to `/workspace/planning/docs/`
   - All existing files and subdirectories preserved

2. **Reference Updates**:
   - Updated `/workspace/planning/inbox/README.md` (line 24)
   - Updated `/workspace/prompts/manager.md` (line 63) 
   - Updated `/workspace/memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` (line 34)

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Updated `planning/INDEX.md` to mark task as completed
   - Created comprehensive work-log entry

### Files Changed

- `planning/done/` → `planning/docs/` (directory rename)
- `planning/inbox/README.md` (reference update)
- `prompts/manager.md` (workflow documentation update)
- `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` (data flow diagram update)
- `planning/INDEX.md` (completion tracking)

### Validation

- ✅ `planning/done/` directory successfully removed
- ✅ `planning/docs/` directory exists with all original content
- ✅ All 6 original files preserved in docs directory
- ✅ All references to old directory path updated
- ✅ No broken references remain
- ✅ System documentation updated consistently

## Technical Notes

- Agent system appeared non-responsive during this task
- Manager coordinated implementation directly while maintaining proper validation
- All changes tested and verified before completion
- Comprehensive search performed to ensure no missed references

## Success Criteria Met

- [x] `planning/done/` no longer exists
- [x] `planning/docs/` contains all previous content  
- [x] All references updated to use new name
- [x] System functions normally with new directory structure
- [x] Documentation reflects the new naming convention

## Next Steps

Task complete. The planning system now uses the more semantically correct "docs" directory name to represent the final documentation step from English requirements to working code.
