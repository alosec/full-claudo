# Work Log: 2025-09-07 18:02 - Implement Structured Planning System

## Task Reference
- Planning Task: Manual implementation of hierarchical planning system
- Status: Completed
- Agent: Manual implementation via Claude Code

## Summary
Implemented comprehensive structured planning system for Full Claudo multi-agent architecture with hierarchical task organization, automated work logging, and updated agent prompts.

## Tasks Completed
- [x] Created planning directory structure with INDEX.md master index
- [x] Built hierarchical tasks/ directory for nested task organization
- [x] Added features/ directory for strategic feature planning
- [x] Implemented work-log/ directory with timestamp-based logging
- [x] Updated Manager agent prompt for planning system awareness
- [x] Updated Planner agent prompt for hierarchical task creation
- [x] Modified manager-runner.ts to auto-initialize planning directories
- [x] Migrated existing plans and cleaned up old structure

## Files Modified

### Created
- `planning/INDEX.md` - Master task index with status tracking and navigation
- `planning/tasks/README.md` - Task organization guidelines and format documentation
- `planning/features/README.md` - Feature planning documentation and templates
- `work-log/README.md` - Work log format documentation and automation guidelines
- `planning/tasks/archive-add-version-flag.yaml` - Migrated existing plan

### Modified
- `prompts/manager.md` - Added planning system awareness, work-log automation, INDEX.md maintenance
- `prompts/planner.md` - Updated for hierarchical task creation, README format, INDEX.md updates
- `src/manager-runner.ts` - Added auto-initialization of planning/ and work-log/ directories
- `memory-bank/activeContext.md` - Updated current status with planning system completion
- `memory-bank/progress.md` - Documented planning system implementation and results

### Deleted
- `.claudo/plans/` directory - Replaced with structured planning/tasks/ hierarchy

## Technical Notes

### Implementation Approach
- **Hierarchical Design**: Tasks nest by specificity (e.g., `tasks/implement-auth/sign-in-page/`)
- **INDEX.md as Source of Truth**: Central tracking of all active and completed tasks
- **Work Log Automation**: Timestamp-based logging with format `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-description.md`
- **Agent Integration**: Manager and Planner prompts updated to understand new structure

### Key Decisions Made
- Chose INDEX.md over README.md for planning root (stronger semantic meaning)
- Used kebab-case for directory names (e.g., `implement-auth`, `sign-in-page`)
- Maintained backward compatibility by archiving existing plans
- Auto-initialized directories in manager-runner.ts for seamless agent startup

### Architecture Benefits
- **Clear Hierarchy**: Tasks organized by specificity with parent/child relationships
- **Automated Logging**: Work completion automatically tracked with timestamps
- **Agent Awareness**: Manager and Planner agents understand planning structure
- **Scalable**: System handles simple to complex multi-step projects

## Testing
- Tests run: `npm run build` 
- Results: Passed - TypeScript compilation successful
- Coverage: All new files and modifications compile correctly

## Follow-up Tasks
- Test planning system with sample hierarchical tasks
- Validate Manager and Planner agent understanding of new structure
- Create sample task hierarchy to demonstrate system capabilities
- Test automated work-log generation when tasks complete

## Architecture Impact
This implementation transforms Full Claudo from a simple task queue system to a sophisticated project management platform with:
- Hierarchical task organization
- Automated progress tracking
- Structured planning workflows
- Enhanced agent coordination

The system maintains the core simplicity principle while adding powerful organizational capabilities.
