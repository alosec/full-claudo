# Fix Parser Types - Completed

## Feature Request
Fix parser type assertions - remove 'as any' usage in test-manager-complex.ts

## Implementation Summary

### Problem
The test-manager-complex.ts file contained two 'as any' type assertions that needed proper typing:
- Line 93: `(parser as any).getStatistics?.()`
- Line 147: `(parser as any).on('parser-error', callback)`

### Solution Implemented
Worker agent successfully:
1. Created proper TypeScript interfaces for parser extensions
2. Replaced `as any` assertions with proper type intersections
3. Maintained functionality while improving type safety

### Files Changed
- `src/test-manager-complex.ts` - removed both 'as any' type assertions

### Validation
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful (npm run build)
- ✅ No 'as any' assertions found in codebase
- ✅ Critic agent validation passed

### Time Spent
~15 minutes

### Agent Coordination
- Manager: Orchestrated the task
- Worker: Implemented the type fixes
- Critic: Validated the implementation

## Technical Details
The Worker agent added proper interface definitions and updated the type assertions to use intersection types instead of `any`, improving type safety without breaking functionality.

## Result
Cleaner, more maintainable TypeScript code with proper type safety.
