## Implementation Time
~10 minutes

## Notes
The Full Claudo multi-agent system has successfully achieved its core goals:
- Simple ~100 lines of TypeScript architecture
- Secure Docker sandboxing
- Autonomous task orchestration
- Clean readable output
- Structured planning and work logging

System is now in maintenance mode, ready to handle new development tasks.
