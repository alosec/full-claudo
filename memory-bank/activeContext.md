# Active Context

## Current Phase
ðŸŽ‰ SYSTEM OPERATIONAL - Core multi-agent architecture working successfully

## Current Status
- âœ… **Project Structure**: Complete directory structure created
- âœ… **TypeScript Infrastructure**: Core scripts (up.ts, down.ts, agent.ts) implemented  
- âœ… **Agent Prompts**: All 5 agent types defined (manager, planner, worker, critic, oracle)
- âœ… **Docker Setup**: Container built successfully with Claude CLI
- âœ… **Build System**: TypeScript compilation working
- âœ… **Manager Working**: Successfully spawned, reads memory-bank, understands project
- âœ… **Streaming Output**: Real-time visibility into Claude's thinking via stream-json
- âœ… **Authentication**: Claude credentials properly mounted in container
- âœ… **Task Queue**: Manager successfully reads and processes task queue

## Architecture Implemented

**Entry Point**: `claudo` bash script routes commands to TypeScript modules
**Core Scripts**:
- `up.ts` - Spawns Manager in Docker container
- `down.ts` - Kills Manager container  
- `agent.ts` - Helper for Manager to spawn other agents

**Communication**: Manager uses Bash tool to call `claudo plan/worker/critic/oracle`

## Test Queue
Sample task ready: "Change index bg to purple"

## System Successfully Working
âœ… **Manager Container**: Running as `claudo-manager` (container c9eda6bc35b0...)
âœ… **Memory Bank Reading**: Manager reads all context files successfully
âœ… **Task Recognition**: Manager found task queue and understands requirements
âœ… **Streaming JSON**: Real-time output shows Claude's tool usage and thinking
âœ… **Docker Security**: Sandboxed execution with proper credential mounting

## Recent Progress

### âœ… **Shell Environment Fixed** (COMPLETED)
- Docker container now includes bash installation and proper SHELL environment
- Manager can successfully use Bash tool for agent spawning

### âœ… **Docker-in-Docker Problem Resolved** (COMPLETED)
- **Solution Chosen**: All-in-One Container approach
- All agents run as Node.js processes within same container (no docker spawning needed)
- New agent.ts spawns Claude CLI processes directly, not containers
- This eliminates complexity while maintaining isolation

### âœ… **Agent Spawning Working** (COMPLETED)
- Manager successfully calls `claudo plan/worker/critic/oracle` commands
- Agent spawn creates temporary prompt files in .claudo/
- Stream parsing provides readable output from agents

### ðŸš§ **Log Parsing & UX** (MEDIUM PRIORITY) 
- Claude CLI outputs verbose JSON streaming logs that are hard to read
- Need parser to convert stream-json to brief, human-readable status updates
- Currently logs are overwhelming and difficult to follow for users

## Next Phase: Architecture Decision
1. **Evaluate**: Docker-in-Docker vs alternative approaches
2. **Decide**: Choose approach based on simplicity vs isolation trade-offs
3. **Implement**: Refactor spawning mechanism accordingly
4. **Create**: Log parser for better UX

## Key Achievement
**Simple Architecture Works**: ~100 lines of TypeScript successfully orchestrates Claude instances
- No complex MCP servers or state machines needed
- File-based prompts solve shell escaping issues  
- Docker provides security without complexity
- Streaming JSON gives real-time visibility
