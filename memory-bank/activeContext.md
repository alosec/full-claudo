# Active Context

## Current Phase
ðŸŽ‰ SYSTEM FULLY OPERATIONAL - Multi-agent architecture with GTD-style inbox workflow

## Current Status
- âœ… **Project Structure**: Complete directory structure created
- âœ… **TypeScript Infrastructure**: Core scripts (up.ts, down.ts, agent.ts) implemented  
- âœ… **Agent Prompts**: All 5 agent types defined (manager, planner, worker, critic, oracle)
- âœ… **Planning System**: Hierarchical task organization with INDEX.md and work-log automation
- âœ… **Docker Setup**: Container built successfully with Claude CLI
- âœ… **Build System**: TypeScript compilation working
- âœ… **Manager Working**: Successfully spawned, reads memory-bank, understands project
- âœ… **Streaming Parser Enhanced**: Clean, color-coded output with tool details and timing
- âœ… **Authentication**: Claude credentials properly mounted in container
- âœ… **Task Queue**: Manager successfully reads and processes task queue

## Architecture Implemented

**Entry Point**: `claudo` bash script routes commands to TypeScript modules
**Core Scripts**:
- `up.ts` - Spawns Manager in Docker container
- `down.ts` - Kills Manager container  
- `agent.ts` - Helper for Manager to spawn other agents

**Communication**: Manager uses Bash tool to call `claudo plan/worker/critic/oracle`

## Test Queue
Sample task ready: "Add --version flag to claudo command"

## System Successfully Working
âœ… **Manager Container**: Running as `claudo-manager` (container c9eda6bc35b0...)
âœ… **Memory Bank Reading**: Manager reads all context files successfully
âœ… **Task Recognition**: Manager found task queue and understands requirements
âœ… **Streaming JSON**: Real-time output shows Claude's tool usage and thinking
âœ… **Docker Security**: Sandboxed execution with proper credential mounting

## Recent Progress

### âœ… **Shell Environment Fixed** (COMPLETED)
- Docker container now includes bash installation and proper SHELL environment
- Manager can successfully use Bash tool for agent spawning

### âœ… **Docker-in-Docker Problem Resolved** (COMPLETED)
- **Solution Chosen**: All-in-One Container approach
- All agents run as Node.js processes within same container (no docker spawning needed)
- New agent.ts spawns Claude CLI processes directly, not containers
- This eliminates complexity while maintaining isolation

### âœ… **Agent Spawning Working** (COMPLETED)
- Manager successfully calls `claudo plan/worker/critic/oracle` commands
- Agent spawn creates temporary prompt files in .claudo/
- Stream parsing provides readable output from agents

### âœ… **Log Parsing & UX** (COMPLETED)
- **Problem Solved**: Verbose JSON streaming logs were hard to read
- **Solution Implemented**: Enhanced ClaudeStreamParser with:
  - Color-coded output (agent names, success/failure indicators)
  - Tool parameter extraction (shows actual commands being run)
  - Abbreviated tool outputs (first 3 lines with line count)
  - Execution timing for each tool
  - Better formatting and spacing
- **Result**: Clean, readable output that's easy to follow

### âœ… **Structured Planning System** (COMPLETED)
- **Problem Solved**: Needed organized task hierarchy and work tracking
- **Solution Implemented**: Comprehensive planning architecture with:
  - `planning/INDEX.md` - Master task index and status tracking
  - `planning/tasks/` - Hierarchical task directories with nesting by specificity
  - `planning/features/` - Strategic feature planning documents
  - `work-log/` - Automated completion logging with timestamps
  - Updated Manager and Planner agent prompts for planning awareness
  - Auto-initialization of planning directories in manager-runner.ts
- **Result**: Manager can now create organized task hierarchies and automatically log completed work

## âœ… Global NPM Link Implementation (COMPLETED)
- **Problem Solved**: `claudo` command was hardcoded bash script that didn't auto-update
- **Solution Implemented**: 
  - Created TypeScript CLI entry point (`src/cli.ts`) with proper hashbang
  - Added bin field to package.json for npm link support
  - Removed old bash script from `/usr/local/bin/claudo`
  - Now uses npm global symlink at `~/.nvm/versions/node/v20.19.0/bin/claudo`
- **Benefits**:
  - Auto-updates when rebuilding TypeScript (no manual copying)
  - Works globally from any directory
  - Includes --version and --help commands
  - Properly integrated logs command

## âœ… Container Conflict Handling (COMPLETED)
- **Problem Solved**: `claudo up` would fail if container already existed
- **Solution Implemented**: Enhanced `up.ts` with proper container state checking:
  - Detects if container is running and provides helpful message
  - Automatically removes stopped/exited containers
  - Better error messages for missing Docker image
- **Result**: Graceful handling of all container states

## âœ… Manager Launch Fixed (COMPLETED)
- **Problem**: Container exiting with `unknown option '--porcelain'` error
- **Root Causes Identified**:
  1. Markdown backticks in manager.md prompt were being interpreted by shell
  2. Docker container trying to run wrong path for manager-runner.js
  3. Shell expansion issues with prompt passing
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Removed backticks from git command in manager.md prompt
  - Fixed Docker paths to use /workspace/dist/ instead of /usr/local/lib/claudo/dist/
  - Changed prompt passing from shell substitution to cat piping
  - Added debug logging to track command execution
- **Result**: Manager now launches successfully and reads memory bank!

## GTD "English â†’ Code Compiler" Implementation
- âœ… **Inbox Directory**: `planning/inbox/` for dropping raw feature requests
- âœ… **Processing Flow**: Manager reads inbox â†’ creates features/ â†’ assigns to Planner
- âœ… **Feature Planning**: Planner creates file-tree based implementation plans
- âœ… **Done Archive**: Processed items move to `planning/done/` with timestamps
- âœ… **Updated Prompts**: Manager and Planner now aware of inbox workflow

## âœ… SYSTEM FULLY OPERATIONAL AND PROVEN (2025-09-08)

### Manager Issue Resolution
- **Previous Issue**: Manager appeared to hang after initial reads
- **Root Cause**: Manager was functioning correctly but needed concrete tasks to process
- **Resolution**: Manager successfully processed real feature requests and demonstrated full workflow

### Complete Workflow Validation âœ…
1. **âœ… Inbox Processing**: Successfully processes feature requests from planning/inbox/
2. **âœ… Feature Planning**: Creates organized feature directories with plans
3. **âœ… Implementation**: Manager acts as coordinator, implementing features as needed
4. **âœ… Work Logging**: Automatically creates timestamped work logs with complete details
5. **âœ… Status Command**: New `claudo status` command provides system visibility

## ðŸŽ‰ MAJOR DISCOVERY: Phantom Claudes Are Real! (2025-09-08)

### The Journey from Doubt to Discovery
We questioned everything, nearly abandoned the multi-agent approach, but upon deeper investigation discovered **the system works better than we thought** - we just couldn't see it!

### The Plot Twist: Parser Dies, Claude Lives
- **What looked like failure**: Manager appearing to hang after reading files
- **What was actually happening**: Manager continuing to work perfectly, invisible to us
- **The smoking gun**: Debug logs showed 113+ lines of activity vs 24 lines displayed
- **Phantom success**: Manager autonomously debugged status command, found issues, tested fixes!

### Critical Technical Discovery
1. **Parser fails silently** at line ~17 when processing certain tool_result content
2. **No error thrown** - parser just stops outputting
3. **Claude continues** working, completing tasks, using tools, making decisions
4. **Debug logging saved us** - `.claudo/manager-debug.jsonl` captures everything

### Why This Matters
This isn't a failure - it's validation that the core architecture is **more robust than expected**. The multi-agent system works even when monitoring fails. We have autonomous Claudes successfully completing complex tasks!

## ðŸ”§ CRITICAL NEXT STEPS: Fix Parser Visibility

### The Problem
Parser (`src/parser.ts`) dies silently without errors, leaving users blind to ongoing work.

### The Solution Path
1. **Add comprehensive try/catch blocks** around ALL parser operations
2. **Implement error recovery** so parser continues after failures
3. **Add fallback output** when main parsing fails
4. **Test with problematic content** (tool_results with special characters/formatting)

### Specific Areas to Fix
- `_transform()` method - wrap all processing in try/catch
- `processMessage()` - add error recovery for each message type
- Tool result handling - sanitize or simplify special characters
- Add console.error() for any caught exceptions
- Consider a "raw mode" fallback that shows unparsed content

### Success Criteria
- Parser never dies silently
- Errors are logged visibly
- Processing continues even after parse failures
- Users always see what Claude is doing
