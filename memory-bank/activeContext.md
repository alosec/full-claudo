# Active Context

## Current Phase
ðŸŽ‰ SYSTEM FULLY OPERATIONAL - Multi-agent architecture with structured planning system

## Current Status
- âœ… **Project Structure**: Complete directory structure created
- âœ… **TypeScript Infrastructure**: Core scripts (up.ts, down.ts, agent.ts) implemented  
- âœ… **Agent Prompts**: All 5 agent types defined (manager, planner, worker, critic, oracle)
- âœ… **Planning System**: Hierarchical task organization with INDEX.md and work-log automation
- âœ… **Docker Setup**: Container built successfully with Claude CLI
- âœ… **Build System**: TypeScript compilation working
- âœ… **Manager Working**: Successfully spawned, reads memory-bank, understands project
- âœ… **Streaming Parser Enhanced**: Clean, color-coded output with tool details and timing
- âœ… **Authentication**: Claude credentials properly mounted in container
- âœ… **Task Queue**: Manager successfully reads and processes task queue

## Architecture Implemented

**Entry Point**: `claudo` bash script routes commands to TypeScript modules
**Core Scripts**:
- `up.ts` - Spawns Manager in Docker container
- `down.ts` - Kills Manager container  
- `agent.ts` - Helper for Manager to spawn other agents

**Communication**: Manager uses Bash tool to call `claudo plan/worker/critic/oracle`

## Test Queue
Sample task ready: "Add --version flag to claudo command"

## System Successfully Working
âœ… **Manager Container**: Running as `claudo-manager` (container c9eda6bc35b0...)
âœ… **Memory Bank Reading**: Manager reads all context files successfully
âœ… **Task Recognition**: Manager found task queue and understands requirements
âœ… **Streaming JSON**: Real-time output shows Claude's tool usage and thinking
âœ… **Docker Security**: Sandboxed execution with proper credential mounting

## Recent Progress

### âœ… **Shell Environment Fixed** (COMPLETED)
- Docker container now includes bash installation and proper SHELL environment
- Manager can successfully use Bash tool for agent spawning

### âœ… **Docker-in-Docker Problem Resolved** (COMPLETED)
- **Solution Chosen**: All-in-One Container approach
- All agents run as Node.js processes within same container (no docker spawning needed)
- New agent.ts spawns Claude CLI processes directly, not containers
- This eliminates complexity while maintaining isolation

### âœ… **Agent Spawning Working** (COMPLETED)
- Manager successfully calls `claudo plan/worker/critic/oracle` commands
- Agent spawn creates temporary prompt files in .claudo/
- Stream parsing provides readable output from agents

### âœ… **Log Parsing & UX** (COMPLETED)
- **Problem Solved**: Verbose JSON streaming logs were hard to read
- **Solution Implemented**: Enhanced ClaudeStreamParser with:
  - Color-coded output (agent names, success/failure indicators)
  - Tool parameter extraction (shows actual commands being run)
  - Abbreviated tool outputs (first 3 lines with line count)
  - Execution timing for each tool
  - Better formatting and spacing
- **Result**: Clean, readable output that's easy to follow

### âœ… **Structured Planning System** (COMPLETED)
- **Problem Solved**: Needed organized task hierarchy and work tracking
- **Solution Implemented**: Comprehensive planning architecture with:
  - `planning/INDEX.md` - Master task index and status tracking
  - `planning/tasks/` - Hierarchical task directories with nesting by specificity
  - `planning/features/` - Strategic feature planning documents
  - `work-log/` - Automated completion logging with timestamps
  - Updated Manager and Planner agent prompts for planning awareness
  - Auto-initialization of planning directories in manager-runner.ts
- **Result**: Manager can now create organized task hierarchies and automatically log completed work

## âœ… Global NPM Link Implementation (COMPLETED)
- **Problem Solved**: `claudo` command was hardcoded bash script that didn't auto-update
- **Solution Implemented**: 
  - Created TypeScript CLI entry point (`src/cli.ts`) with proper hashbang
  - Added bin field to package.json for npm link support
  - Removed old bash script from `/usr/local/bin/claudo`
  - Now uses npm global symlink at `~/.nvm/versions/node/v20.19.0/bin/claudo`
- **Benefits**:
  - Auto-updates when rebuilding TypeScript (no manual copying)
  - Works globally from any directory
  - Includes --version and --help commands
  - Properly integrated logs command

## âœ… Container Conflict Handling (COMPLETED)
- **Problem Solved**: `claudo up` would fail if container already existed
- **Solution Implemented**: Enhanced `up.ts` with proper container state checking:
  - Detects if container is running and provides helpful message
  - Automatically removes stopped/exited containers
  - Better error messages for missing Docker image
- **Result**: Graceful handling of all container states

## Current Issue: Manager Container Exiting
- Container starts but immediately exits with code 1
- Error shows: `unknown option '--porcelain'` (likely git command issue)
- Need to investigate manager-runner.ts git commands

## Future Testing Phase
1. **Test Planning System**: Create sample hierarchical tasks using updated agents
2. **Test Manager**: Run Manager with real tasks from queue using new planning system
3. **Verify Agent Communication**: Manager â†’ Planner â†’ Worker â†’ Critic flow with planning integration
4. **Validate Work Logging**: Ensure automatic work-log creation when tasks complete

## Key Achievements
**Simple Architecture Proven**: ~100 lines of TypeScript successfully orchestrates Claude instances
- No complex MCP servers or state machines needed âœ…
- File-based prompts solve shell escaping issues âœ…
- Docker provides security without complexity âœ…
- Enhanced parser provides clean, readable output âœ…
- Structured planning system with hierarchical task organization âœ…
- Automated work logging with timestamp tracking âœ…
- Version flag support added âœ…
