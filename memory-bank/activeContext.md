# Active Context

## Current Phase
🎉 SYSTEM OPERATIONAL - Core multi-agent architecture working successfully

## Current Status
- ✅ **Project Structure**: Complete directory structure created
- ✅ **TypeScript Infrastructure**: Core scripts (up.ts, down.ts, agent.ts) implemented  
- ✅ **Agent Prompts**: All 5 agent types defined (manager, planner, worker, critic, oracle)
- ✅ **Docker Setup**: Container built successfully with Claude CLI
- ✅ **Build System**: TypeScript compilation working
- ✅ **Manager Working**: Successfully spawned, reads memory-bank, understands project
- ✅ **Streaming Output**: Real-time visibility into Claude's thinking via stream-json
- ✅ **Authentication**: Claude credentials properly mounted in container
- ✅ **Task Queue**: Manager successfully reads and processes task queue

## Architecture Implemented

**Entry Point**: `claudo` bash script routes commands to TypeScript modules
**Core Scripts**:
- `up.ts` - Spawns Manager in Docker container
- `down.ts` - Kills Manager container  
- `agent.ts` - Helper for Manager to spawn other agents

**Communication**: Manager uses Bash tool to call `claudo plan/worker/critic/oracle`

## Test Queue
Sample task ready: "Change index bg to purple"

## System Successfully Working
✅ **Manager Container**: Running as `claudo-manager` (container c9eda6bc35b0...)
✅ **Memory Bank Reading**: Manager reads all context files successfully
✅ **Task Recognition**: Manager found task queue and understands requirements
✅ **Streaming JSON**: Real-time output shows Claude's tool usage and thinking
✅ **Docker Security**: Sandboxed execution with proper credential mounting

## Current Blockers

### 🚧 **Docker-in-Docker Problem** (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Manager runs in Docker container but tries to spawn other agents via `docker run`
- ERROR: "/bin/sh: docker: not found" - Docker not available inside container
- This is a fundamental architectural issue requiring design decision

**Possible Solutions:**
1. **Docker-in-Docker (DinD)**: Install Docker in container + mount socket
2. **Host-level Agent Spawning**: Manager communicates spawn requests to host  
3. **All-in-One Container**: Run all agents in same container with process isolation
4. **Host-based Manager**: Move Manager to host, keep agents in containers

**Decision Status**: ⏳ Pending architectural decision

### 🚧 **Log Parsing & UX** (MEDIUM PRIORITY) 
- Claude CLI outputs verbose JSON streaming logs that are hard to read
- Need parser to convert stream-json to brief, human-readable status updates
- Currently logs are overwhelming and difficult to follow for users

## Next Phase: Architecture Decision
1. **Evaluate**: Docker-in-Docker vs alternative approaches
2. **Decide**: Choose approach based on simplicity vs isolation trade-offs
3. **Implement**: Refactor spawning mechanism accordingly
4. **Create**: Log parser for better UX

## Key Achievement
**Simple Architecture Works**: ~100 lines of TypeScript successfully orchestrates Claude instances
- No complex MCP servers or state machines needed
- File-based prompts solve shell escaping issues  
- Docker provides security without complexity
- Streaming JSON gives real-time visibility
