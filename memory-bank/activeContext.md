## Current Phase
ðŸ”„ STRATEGIC PIVOT: Interactive Manager Mode for Direct Debugging (2025-09-09)

## Latest Updates: Custom Prompt File Support
Successfully implemented `--prompt-file` functionality for agent commands:

### Changes Made:
1. **Execution Context System (new):**
   - Created `src/execution-context.ts` for detecting Docker vs native environment
   - Created `src/prompt-resolver.ts` for cross-context prompt path resolution
   - Agents default to native execution, Manager to Docker

2. **CLI Enhancements:**
   - Added `--prompt-file=<path>` flag for custom prompts
   - Added `--docker` flag to force Docker execution
   - Added `--native`/`--host` flags to force native execution
   - Updated `claudo` bash script to route through cli.js for unified handling

3. **Agent Refactoring:**
   - Fixed critical issue: prompts containing "--" were being parsed as CLI arguments
   - Switched from `-p` flag with shell expansion to stdin piping
   - Removed dependency on shell: true, now using direct stdin
   - Dynamic prompt resolution based on execution context

4. **Docker Utils Extensions:**
   - Added execution context preference functions
   - Fallback logic when Docker unavailable
   - Context resolution with user override support

### Result:
âœ… **Custom prompts work from HOST**: `claudo plan --prompt-file=./custom.md "task"` works when called from host
âœ… **Manager spawning working**: Manager can spawn agents using `node dist/src/agent.js plan "task"`
âœ… **Critical solution found**: Direct node calls bypass claudo routing and work perfectly in container

## Interactive Manager Mode - BLOCKED (2025-09-09)

### Current Status: TTY/Raw Mode Incompatibility
Attempted to implement interactive Manager mode (`claudo up -it`) but hit fundamental blocker:

#### The Problem
1. **Claude CLI requires raw TTY mode** for interactive sessions (uses Ink library)
2. **Docker stdio pipes don't support raw mode** properly
3. **Result**: Error "Raw mode is not supported on the current process.stdin"

#### Attempted Solutions (All Failed)
1. **Direct stdio inherit**: Claude crashes with raw mode error
2. **Using --print flag**: Works but makes it non-interactive (single response only)
3. **Using script command**: Not available in minimal Docker container
4. **Pseudo-TTY via script**: Would need to install additional tools in container

#### Root Cause
The Claude Code CLI is designed for direct terminal use and expects full TTY capabilities. Docker's `-it` flag provides some TTY emulation but not enough for Claude's Ink-based UI which requires raw mode control.

#### Next Steps for New Session
Consider alternative approaches:
1. **Run Manager on host** (not in Docker) for `-it` mode
2. **Create verbose debug mode** that logs all Manager decisions without interactivity
3. **Install necessary TTY tools** in Docker image (script, socat, etc.)
4. **Use different CLI approach** that doesn't require raw mode

## Previous Attempts Summary

### Subagent Visibility Attempts
1. **Session ID extraction from verbose mode** - Verbose doesn't output session ID without stream-json
2. **Stream-JSON parsing** - Works but creates context pollution for Manager
3. **Log file monitoring** - Session files created but real-time tailing complex
4. **Standalone logs mode** - Implemented but monitoring not detecting sessions properly

### Complexity Issues Encountered
- Shell escaping in prompts (backticks in markdown)
- JSON escaping in tool parameters
- Mixed stdout streams (debug text + JSON)
- Session file discovery timing issues
- Parser synchronization problems

## System Status
- âœ… **Manager Function**: Works correctly, processes tasks, reads memory-bank
- âœ… **Agent Spawning from Manager**: WORKING - Manager spawns agents using `node dist/src/agent.js [type] "task"`
- âœ… **Custom Prompts from Host**: --prompt-file works when called directly from host
- âœ… **Execution Context**: Automatic detection of Docker vs native environment
- âœ… **Session Monitoring**: Session ID capture implemented
- âœ… **Clean Communication**: Text responses via stdin, no shell expansion issues
- âœ… **Direct Node Execution**: Agents work perfectly when called directly with node
- âœ… **Response Capture**: Manager receives clean text responses from agents
- âœ… **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Full Manager â†’ Planner â†’ Worker â†’ Critic flow confirmed working

## Key Files
- `src/host-parser.ts` - Host-based parser reading docker logs
- `src/manager-runner.ts` - Outputs both debug and JSON to stdout
- `.claudo/manager-debug.jsonl` - Clean JSON stream (reliable)
- `docker logs claudo-manager` - Mixed output stream (problematic)

## The Pattern
Every layer we add seems to create new escaping/mixing problems:
- Shell â†’ Markdown escaping
- Process â†’ JSON escaping  
- Docker â†’ Stream mixing

Perhaps the solution is fewer layers, not more parsing.
