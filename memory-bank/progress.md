# Development Progress

## Major Milestone: Simple Multi-Agent System Successfully Implemented âœ…

### Core System Working
- âœ… **Project Structure Setup**: All core directories and files created
- âœ… **TypeScript Infrastructure**: up.ts, down.ts, agent.ts implemented and working
- âœ… **Agent Prompt System**: All 5 agent types defined with specialized prompts
- âœ… **Docker Integration**: Container setup with Claude CLI and working authentication
- âœ… **Build System**: TypeScript compilation configured and working
- âœ… **Entry Script**: `claudo` bash script for command routing working
- âœ… **Manager Operational**: Successfully spawned in Docker, reading memory-bank
- âœ… **Streaming Output**: Real-time Claude visibility via `--output-format stream-json`
- âœ… **Task Queue**: Manager successfully reads and processes `.claudo/queue.txt`
- âœ… **Shell Escaping Fix**: File-based prompts prevent command injection issues

## Current System Status
ðŸŽ‰ **CORE ARCHITECTURE WORKING** - Manager Claude successfully orchestrating in Docker

### Manager Container Status
- **Container**: `claudo-manager` (c9eda6bc35b0...)
- **Status**: Running and operational
- **Capabilities**: Reading memory-bank, understanding tasks, streaming JSON output
- **Authentication**: Claude credentials properly mounted and working

## Active Task Queue
- âœ… Add --version flag to claudo command (completed successfully)

## Recent Task Completion
**Task**: Add --version flag to claudo command
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED
**Implementation**: 
- Added --version and -v flag support to claudo bash script
- Flags extract version from package.json (currently 1.0.0)
- Updated usage message and README documentation
- All existing functionality preserved and tested

## Critical Issues Resolved âœ…
ðŸŽ‰ **Shell Environment Fixed**: Docker now includes bash and proper SHELL environment
ðŸŽ‰ **Agent Spawning Working**: All-in-one container approach eliminates Docker-in-Docker complexity
ðŸŽ‰ **Multi-Agent Communication**: Manager successfully spawns Planner, Worker, Critic, Oracle agents

## Recent Enhancement: Stream Parser UX Improvement âœ…
**Completed**: Enhanced ClaudeStreamParser for better readability
**Changes**:
- Added color-coded output with ANSI escape sequences
- Tool parameters extracted and displayed (e.g., shows actual bash commands)
- Abbreviated tool outputs (first 3 lines with line count)
- Execution timing for each tool operation
- Better spacing and formatting for readability

**Result**: Transformed verbose JSON into clean, readable status updates

## Latest Enhancement: Structured Planning System âœ…
**Completed**: Comprehensive hierarchical task organization and work logging
**Implementation**:
- Created `planning/INDEX.md` as master task index with status tracking
- Built `planning/tasks/` directory for hierarchical task organization (e.g., `tasks/implement-auth/sign-in-page/`)
- Added `planning/features/` for strategic feature planning documents
- Implemented `work-log/` directory with automated timestamp-based completion logging
- Updated Manager agent prompt for planning system awareness and work-log automation
- Updated Planner agent prompt for hierarchical task creation and INDEX.md maintenance
- Modified manager-runner.ts to auto-initialize planning directories
- Migrated existing plans and removed old `.claudo/plans/` structure

**Result**: Agents now create organized task hierarchies and automatically log completed work with full traceability

## Major Achievement
**Simple Architecture Validated**: ~100 lines of TypeScript successfully orchestrates Claude instances
- No complex MCP servers needed âœ…
- No complex state machines needed âœ…  
- File-based prompts work âœ…
- Docker security works âœ…
- Enhanced streaming parser works âœ…
- Memory-bank integration works âœ…
- Structured planning system works âœ…
- Automated work logging works âœ…

## Next Phase: Infrastructure & Accessibility
1. **Docker Container Rebuild**: Update container with latest TypeScript changes and planning system
2. **Script Accessibility Fix**: Ensure claudo script works from any project directory, not just full-claudo/
3. **Global Command Setup**: Make claudo globally available and properly configured
4. **Cross-Project Testing**: Verify system works when invoked from different directories
5. **Container Validation**: Test planning system initialization in rebuilt container

## Future Testing Phase  
1. **Planning System Test**: Create sample hierarchical tasks using updated agents
2. **Full System Test**: Run Manager with real tasks using new planning system
3. **Agent Communication Test**: Manager â†’ Planner â†’ Worker â†’ Critic flow with planning integration
4. **Work Logging Validation**: Ensure automatic work-log creation when tasks complete
5. **Documentation**: Update README with planning system features

## Key Innovation Proven
The vision works: A Manager Claude can orchestrate other Claude instances through simple process spawning, with clean readable output, replacing complex multi-agent frameworks with elegant simplicity.
