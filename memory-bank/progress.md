## Current System Status
ðŸŽ‰ **CORE ARCHITECTURE WORKING** - Manager Claude successfully orchestrating in Docker

### Manager Container Status
- **Container**: `claudo-manager` (c9eda6bc35b0...)
- **Status**: Running and operational
- **Capabilities**: Reading memory-bank, understanding tasks, streaming JSON output
- **Authentication**: Claude credentials properly mounted and working

## Active Task Queue
- âœ… Add --version flag to claudo command (completed successfully)

## Recent Task Completion
**Task**: Add --version flag to claudo command
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED
**Implementation**: 
- Added --version and -v flag support to claudo bash script
- Flags extract version from package.json (currently 1.0.0)
- Updated usage message and README documentation
- All existing functionality preserved and tested

## Critical Issues Resolved âœ…
ðŸŽ‰ **Shell Environment Fixed**: Docker now includes bash and proper SHELL environment
ðŸŽ‰ **Agent Spawning Working**: All-in-one container approach eliminates Docker-in-Docker complexity
ðŸŽ‰ **Multi-Agent Communication**: Manager successfully spawns Planner, Worker, Critic, Oracle agents

## Recent Enhancement: Stream Parser UX Improvement âœ…
**Completed**: Enhanced ClaudeStreamParser for better readability
**Changes**:
- Added color-coded output with ANSI escape sequences
- Tool parameters extracted and displayed (e.g., shows actual bash commands)
- Abbreviated tool outputs (first 3 lines with line count)
- Execution timing for each tool operation
- Better spacing and formatting for readability

**Result**: Transformed verbose JSON into clean, readable status updates

## Latest Enhancement: Structured Planning System âœ…
**Completed**: Comprehensive hierarchical task organization and work logging
**Implementation**:
- Created `planning/INDEX.md` as master task index with status tracking
- Built `planning/tasks/` directory for hierarchical task organization (e.g., `tasks/implement-auth/sign-in-page/`)
- Added `planning/features/` for strategic feature planning documents
- Implemented `work-log/` directory with automated timestamp-based completion logging
- Updated Manager agent prompt for planning system awareness and work-log automation
- Updated Planner agent prompt for hierarchical task creation and INDEX.md maintenance
- Modified manager-runner.ts to auto-initialize planning directories
- Migrated existing plans and removed old `.claudo/plans/` structure

**Result**: Agents now create organized task hierarchies and automatically log completed work with full traceability

## Major Achievement
**Simple Architecture Validated**: ~100 lines of TypeScript successfully orchestrates Claude instances
- No complex MCP servers needed âœ…
- No complex state machines needed âœ…  
- File-based prompts work âœ…
- Docker security works âœ…
- Enhanced streaming parser works âœ…
- Memory-bank integration works âœ…
- Structured planning system works âœ…

## âœ… NPM Link Implementation (COMPLETED)
**Problem**: `claudo` command was a hardcoded bash script that didn't auto-update with code changes
**Solution**: 
- Created TypeScript CLI entry point (`src/cli.ts`) with proper hashbang
- Added bin field to package.json for npm link support  
- Ran `npm link` to create global symlink
- Removed old bash script from `/usr/local/bin/claudo`

**Benefits**:
- Auto-updates when rebuilding TypeScript (no manual copying)
- Works globally from any directory
- Includes --version and --help commands
- Properly integrated logs command

## âœ… Container Conflict Resolution (COMPLETED)
**Problem**: `claudo up` would fail with "container name already in use" error
**Solution**: Enhanced `up.ts` with proper container state checking
- Detects if container is running and provides helpful message
- Automatically removes stopped/exited containers
- Better error messages for missing Docker image

**Result**: Graceful handling of all container states

## âœ… Manager Launch Issue Fixed (COMPLETED)
**Problem**: Manager container exiting with `unknown option '--porcelain'` error
**Root Causes**:
- Markdown backticks in manager.md prompt being interpreted by shell
- Incorrect Docker paths for manager-runner.js
- Shell expansion issues with prompt passing

**Solution Implemented**:
- Removed backticks from git command in manager.md prompt
- Fixed Docker paths to use /workspace/dist/ instead of /usr/local/lib/claudo/dist/
- Changed prompt passing from shell substitution to cat piping
- Added debug logging to track command execution

**Result**: Manager now launches successfully and reads memory bank files!

## âœ… Parser Architecture Simplified (COMPLETED)
**Problem**: Console.log stopping after ~3 seconds in Docker container
**Solution**: Moved parser to host machine where console.log works reliably
**Implementation**:
- Removed `tty-detector.ts` and all TTY detection logic
- Simplified `up.ts` to always use detached mode with host parser  
- Simplified `manager-runner.ts` to output raw JSON only
- Created `host-parser.ts` for reliable host-based parsing
- Updated `logs.ts` to use host-based parser for live output

**Result**: âœ… Simple, reliable, and maintainable architecture - no more complex output issues

## âœ… Enhanced Docker Integration (COMPLETED 2025-09-08)
**Achievement**: Complete Docker workflow automation and improved user experience
**Implementation**:
- **Auto-build functionality**: `claudo up` now automatically builds Docker image if missing
- **New CLI commands**: Added `claudo build` and `claudo rebuild` for manual image management
- **Enhanced status**: Status command now shows Docker image information and health
- **DockerManager class**: Centralized Docker operations with state tracking
- **Utility functions**: Robust Docker utilities with proper error handling
- **Better UX**: Clear error messages and helpful guidance for users

**Result**: âœ… Zero-configuration startup - users can run `claudo up` immediately after clone
