# Development Progress

## Major Milestone: Simple Multi-Agent System Successfully Implemented âœ…

### Core System Working
- âœ… **Project Structure Setup**: All core directories and files created
- âœ… **TypeScript Infrastructure**: up.ts, down.ts, agent.ts implemented and working
- âœ… **Agent Prompt System**: All 5 agent types defined with specialized prompts
- âœ… **Docker Integration**: Container setup with Claude CLI and working authentication
- âœ… **Build System**: TypeScript compilation configured and working
- âœ… **Entry Script**: `claudo` bash script for command routing working
- âœ… **Manager Operational**: Successfully spawned in Docker, reading memory-bank
- âœ… **Streaming Output**: Real-time Claude visibility via `--output-format stream-json`
- âœ… **Task Queue**: Manager successfully reads and processes `.claudo/queue.txt`
- âœ… **Shell Escaping Fix**: File-based prompts prevent command injection issues

## Current System Status
ðŸŽ‰ **CORE ARCHITECTURE WORKING** - Manager Claude successfully orchestrating in Docker

### Manager Container Status
- **Container**: `claudo-manager` (c9eda6bc35b0...)
- **Status**: Running and operational
- **Capabilities**: Reading memory-bank, understanding tasks, streaming JSON output
- **Authentication**: Claude credentials properly mounted and working

## Active Task Queue
- âœ… Add --version flag to claudo command (completed successfully)

## Recent Task Completion
**Task**: Add --version flag to claudo command
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED
**Implementation**: 
- Added --version and -v flag support to claudo bash script
- Flags extract version from package.json (currently 1.0.0)
- Updated usage message and README documentation
- All existing functionality preserved and tested

## Critical Issues Resolved âœ…
ðŸŽ‰ **Shell Environment Fixed**: Docker now includes bash and proper SHELL environment
ðŸŽ‰ **Agent Spawning Working**: All-in-one container approach eliminates Docker-in-Docker complexity
ðŸŽ‰ **Multi-Agent Communication**: Manager successfully spawns Planner, Worker, Critic, Oracle agents

## Major Achievement
**Simple Architecture Validated**: ~100 lines of TypeScript successfully orchestrates Claude instances
- No complex MCP servers needed âœ…
- No complex state machines needed âœ…  
- File-based prompts work âœ…
- Docker security works âœ…
- Streaming JSON visibility works âœ…
- Memory-bank integration works âœ…

## Next Phase
1. **Shell Environment Fix**: Configure proper POSIX shell in Docker container
2. **Agent Spawning Test**: Manager â†’ Planner workflow validation  
3. **Full Pipeline**: Manager â†’ Planner â†’ Worker â†’ Critic workflow
4. **Task Completion**: Process test task end-to-end with git commit

## Key Innovation Proven
The vision works: A Manager Claude can orchestrate other Claude instances through simple process spawning, replacing complex multi-agent frameworks with elegant simplicity.
