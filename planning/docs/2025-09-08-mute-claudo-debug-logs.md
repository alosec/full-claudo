# Mute Claudo Debug Logs - COMPLETED

## Problem
The claudo-debug logs were very verbose and polluting the logs now that we have responses working. They had become noise rather than useful debugging information.

## Solution Implemented
Cleaned up verbose debug logging by:

1. **Removed noisy chunk logging** from `src/host-parser.ts:64`
   - Eliminated `[claudo-debug] Received ${chunk.length} bytes from tail (total: ${this.bytesRead})` message
   - Kept essential data flow monitoring but removed console output

2. **Cleaned up DEBUG messages** from `src/manager-runner.ts`
   - Removed 5 verbose `console.error('[claudo] DEBUG: ...)` statements
   - Lines removed: prompt file saves, prompt length, command execution, raw JSON logging

3. **Created configuration system** in `src/config.ts`
   - Added `DEBUG_MODE` environment variable support
   - Created `debugLog()` function for conditional debug output
   - Added `isDebugMode()` helper for debug checks
   - Future-proof solution for re-enabling debug when needed

## Files Modified
- `src/host-parser.ts` - Removed verbose chunk logging
- `src/manager-runner.ts` - Removed DEBUG console.error messages  
- `src/config.ts` - New configuration system with DEBUG_MODE support

## Build Verification
- `npm run build` completed successfully with no TypeScript errors
- Compiled JavaScript automatically updated in `dist/src/host-parser.js`

## Usage
To re-enable debug logging when needed:
```bash
DEBUG_MODE=true ./your-command
```

## Result
- Significantly cleaner log output
- Essential monitoring still functional
- Debug capability preserved via environment variable
- No impact on core functionality
