testing_strategy:
  - "Monitor `claudo logs -f` during execution for full visibility"
  - "Verify each agent produces expected outputs"
  - "Confirm hello-world.txt contains current timestamp"
  - "Validate task moves through all workflow stages"
  - "Check all metadata files are created correctly"

completion_criteria:
  - "hello-world.txt file exists in project root"
  - "File contains current timestamp and expected message"
  - "All agent interactions are visible in logs"
  - "Task is documented in work-log/ with completion status"
  - "No manual intervention required during execution"
  - "Session capture works for all spawned agents"
