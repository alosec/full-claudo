# Task: Simple Test Task

## Status
- [ ] Not Started
- Created: 2025-09-09
- Priority: High

## Description
Create and execute a minimal test task to validate the complete multi-agent workflow. This serves as a basic end-to-end test of the system's ability to process tasks from planning through execution.

## Requirements
- Demonstrate Manager → Planner → Worker → Critic orchestration works
- Validate session ID capture and visibility
- Test file creation and modification capabilities
- Verify task completion and status updates
- Ensure all agents can communicate effectively

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Task is created in planning/tasks/ directory structure
- [ ] Manager can read and understand the task requirements  
- [ ] Planner creates a detailed implementation plan
- [ ] Worker executes the planned changes successfully
- [ ] Critic validates the implementation meets requirements
- [ ] All agent activities are visible via `claudo logs -f`
- [ ] Task is marked complete and documented

## Implementation Steps
1. Create a simple task: "Create a hello-world.txt file with current timestamp"
2. Test Manager task pickup and orchestration
3. Validate Planner creates appropriate implementation plan
4. Execute through Worker agent with file creation
5. Review with Critic for quality validation
6. Verify visibility of all agent interactions
7. Document results and mark task complete

## Files to Create
- `hello-world.txt` - Simple text file with timestamp (Worker creates this)
- Task completion documentation in work-log/

## Technical Notes
This is designed as the simplest possible end-to-end test:
- Minimal file creation task (no complex logic)  
- Clear success criteria (file exists with expected content)
- Tests core system functionality without complexity
- Validates agent coordination and communication

## Success Metrics
- Task completes without manual intervention
- All 5 agents participate in workflow as designed
- File is created with correct content and timestamp
- User has full visibility into the process via logs
- System demonstrates autonomous task execution

## Test Command
```bash
# Add task to queue and monitor execution
echo "Create a hello-world.txt file with current timestamp" >> .claudo/queue.txt
claudo logs -f
```
