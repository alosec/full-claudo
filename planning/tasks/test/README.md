# Task: Multi-Agent System Test

## Status
- [ ] Not Started
- Created: 2025-09-09
- Priority: High

## Description
Comprehensive test to validate the full multi-agent workflow of the Full Claudo system. This test will verify that the Manager can successfully coordinate Planner, Worker, and Critic agents to complete a simple but complete software development task.

## Requirements
- Test Manager agent spawning and coordination
- Validate Planner creates proper implementation plans
- Verify Worker can execute code changes safely
- Confirm Critic can review and validate implementations
- Test the hierarchical planning system integration
- Validate Docker container execution environment
- Ensure git integration works for automatic saves

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Manager successfully spawns Planner agent
- [ ] Planner creates detailed implementation plan in planning/tasks/
- [ ] Manager successfully spawns Worker agent
- [ ] Worker executes planned changes without errors
- [ ] All changes are committed to git automatically
- [ ] System logs capture complete agent interaction flow
- [ ] No phantom processes or container conflicts
- [ ] Test can be repeated reliably

## Implementation Steps
1. Create a simple test task for the agents to work on
2. Add test task to the queue system
3. Start Manager with `claudo up`
4. Monitor agent spawning and communication
5. Verify each agent completes their role successfully
6. Check git commits are created automatically
7. Validate planning system is updated correctly
8. Clean up and document results

## Files to Modify
- `.claudo/queue.txt` - Add test task to queue
- `planning/tasks/test/test-results.md` - Document test execution results
- May create additional test files as needed by Worker agent

## Test Task
The test task will be: "Create a simple calculator function that adds two numbers and include a basic test"

This task is:
- Simple enough to complete quickly
- Complex enough to require planning
- Generates measurable artifacts (code + test)
- Easy to validate for correctness

## Success Metrics
- Complete workflow execution in under 10 minutes
- All agents complete their tasks without errors
- Generated code passes basic functionality tests
- Git history shows proper commit sequence
- Planning system reflects completed work
