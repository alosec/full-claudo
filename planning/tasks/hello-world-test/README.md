- Created: 2025-09-09
- Priority: Low

## Description
Create a simple "hello world" test to validate basic testing infrastructure and demonstrate successful task completion in the multi-agent system.

## Requirements
- Create a basic hello world test that outputs "Hello, World!"
- Use existing Node.js/TypeScript infrastructure 
- Follow project testing patterns
- Ensure test can be run via npm scripts
- Validate that test passes successfully

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Hello world test file created in appropriate location
- [ ] Test outputs "Hello, World!" when executed
- [ ] Test can be run via npm script (e.g., `npm run test:hello`)
- [ ] Test passes without errors
- [ ] Follows existing project code style and structure

## Implementation Steps
1. Analyze existing test patterns in the codebase
2. Create hello world test file in appropriate test directory
3. Implement simple test that outputs "Hello, World!"  
4. Add npm script to run the test
5. Verify test execution and success

## Files to Modify
- `test/hello-world.test.ts` - Create new test file
- `package.json` - Add npm script for running hello world test

## Testing Strategy
- Manual execution of test file
- Verification via npm script
- Confirm output matches expected "Hello, World!" string

## Completion Criteria
- Test file exists and is executable
- Npm script successfully runs the test
- Test output displays "Hello, World!"
- No errors during test execution
