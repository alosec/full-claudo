task: "Create a simple hello world test to validate basic testing infrastructure"
priority: low
estimated_effort: "15-30 minutes"
dependencies: []

analysis:
  current_state: |
    - Project uses TypeScript with ES2020 target
    - Tests are in /test directory and compile to /dist/test
    - Existing test pattern: parser.test.ts with comprehensive edge case testing
    - Build system: npm run build compiles TS to JS in /dist
    - Test execution: npm scripts run built JS files from /dist
    - Test output: Uses console.log with emoji status indicators (✅❌)
    
  requirements: |
    - Create simple hello world test following existing patterns
    - Test should output "Hello, World!" when executed
    - Follow existing TypeScript and npm script patterns
    - Use same execution model as parser.test.ts
    
  approach: |
    - Create test/hello-world.test.ts following parser.test.ts structure
    - Use shebang, TypeScript imports, and export pattern
    - Add npm script to package.json for execution
    - Keep test simple but consistent with project style

implementation_steps:
  - step: "Create hello-world.test.ts file"
    files: ["test/hello-world.test.ts"]
    type: "create"
    description: "Simple test file that outputs 'Hello, World!' with success indicator"
    
  - step: "Add npm script for hello world test"
    files: ["package.json"]  
    type: "modify"
    description: "Add 'test:hello' script that builds and runs the hello world test"
    
  - step: "Verify test execution"
    files: []
    type: "verify"
    description: "Run npm run test:hello to ensure it works correctly"

testing_strategy:
  - "Manual execution via npm run test:hello"
  - "Verify 'Hello, World!' output appears"
  - "Confirm success exit code (0)"
  - "Test that build step completes without errors"

completion_criteria:
  - "test/hello-world.test.ts exists and compiles successfully"
  - "npm run test:hello executes without errors"
  - "Output displays 'Hello, World!' message"
  - "Test follows existing project code style and patterns"
  - "Build process includes the new test file"
