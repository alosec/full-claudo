task: "Test Agent Spawning Functionality - Validate Planner Agent Task Creation"
priority: high
estimated_effort: "2-3 hours"
dependencies: ["memory-bank files readable", "planning system structure", "claudo command available"]

analysis:
  current_state: |
    - Full Claudo multi-agent system is implemented (~100 lines TypeScript)
    - Manager agent successfully reads memory-bank for context
    - Planning hierarchy structure is established in planning/tasks/
    - Agent spawning system exists but has critical blocker
    - Custom prompt support implemented but Manager cannot spawn agents from container
    
  requirements: |
    - Validate Planner agent can read and understand memory-bank context
    - Test hierarchical task creation following established structure
    - Verify README.md formatting follows project standards  
    - Confirm planning/INDEX.md integration works correctly
    - Demonstrate complete planning workflow from analysis to task creation
    
  approach: |
    Create a concrete test scenario where the Planner agent must:
    1. Analyze memory-bank to understand project context
    2. Create a new task directory with proper hierarchical structure
    3. Write comprehensive README.md following format standards
    4. Update planning/INDEX.md to reflect the new task
    5. Demonstrate understanding of the agent architecture and current blockers

    type: "create"
    description: "Create comprehensive report of test outcomes"

testing_strategy:
  - "Manual verification of each acceptance criterion"
  - "Cross-reference created task against existing task examples"
  - "Validate README.md format matches established templates"
  - "Check planning/INDEX.md for proper task registration"
  - "Verify evidence of memory-bank context comprehension"

completion_criteria:
  - "Planner agent successfully spawned via claudo plan command"
  - "New task directory created following hierarchical naming conventions"
  - "README.md contains all required sections in proper format"
  - "planning/INDEX.md updated to include new task"
  - "Documentation shows clear understanding of Full Claudo architecture"
  - "Test demonstrates that Planner agent can analyze and create tasks autonomously"

blockers:
  - "Critical issue: Manager agent cannot spawn subagents with custom prompts from container"
  - "Agent spawning from Docker container fails - may need host-based testing"
  - "If claudo command not available in current context, test may need adaptation"

success_metrics:
  - "Task creation follows exact format specified in planning/tasks/README.md"
  - "Evidence of memory-bank analysis in task documentation"
  - "Proper hierarchical directory structure maintained"
  - "INDEX.md integration seamless and correct"
  - "Agent demonstrates full understanding of project context and patterns"
