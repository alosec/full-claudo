# Implementation Notes: Test Agent Spawning

## Planning Analysis Complete ‚úÖ

### Context Understanding Achieved
- **Full Claudo Architecture**: 5-agent system (Manager, Planner, Worker, Critic, Oracle)
- **Current Status**: Manager runs in Docker, custom prompt support implemented
- **Critical Blocker**: Manager cannot spawn agents from container (agent spawning broken)
- **Security Model**: Docker sandboxes with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
- **Communication**: Clean text responses, session monitoring via logs

### Planning Structure Analysis
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Parent tasks with subtask nesting
- **README Format**: Status, Description, Requirements, Acceptance Criteria, Implementation Steps
- **Integration**: planning/INDEX.md tracks active/completed tasks
- **File Tracking**: Clear documentation of created/modified files

### Test Strategy Defined
Created concrete test scenario: "Create a status dashboard showing current state of all agents and their recent activity"

## Next Phase: Test Execution

### Pre-Test Validation
Before executing the agent spawn test, verify:

1. **claudo command availability**:
   ```bash
   which claudo
   claudo --version
   ```

2. **Docker environment check**:
   ```bash
   docker ps | grep claudo
   ```

3. **Working directory context**:
   ```bash
   pwd
   ls -la .claudo/
   ```

### Test Execution Commands

#### Primary Test (if claudo available):
```bash
claudo plan "Create a status dashboard that shows the current state of all running agents and their recent activity"
```

#### Fallback Test (if spawning blocked):
Document the blocker and validate planning without actual agent spawning.

### Expected Validation Points

1. **Memory-Bank Context Evidence**:
   - Task references Docker architecture
   - Mentions current agent spawning blocker
   - Shows understanding of 5-agent system
   - References session monitoring patterns

2. **Structural Compliance**:
   - Directory: `planning/tasks/implement-status-dashboard/`
   - Complete README.md with all sections
   - planning/INDEX.md updated correctly
   - Proper priority assignment

3. **Technical Accuracy**:
   - Understands Manager-Agent communication
   - References streaming JSON and clean text responses  
   - Mentions Docker container architecture
   - Shows awareness of current blockers

### Success Metrics

- [ ] **Agent Spawn**: Successfully spawned Planner agent
- [ ] **Context Read**: Evidence of memory-bank file analysis
- [ ] **Task Create**: New task directory with proper structure
- [ ] **Format Match**: README follows established template exactly
- [ ] **Index Update**: planning/INDEX.md correctly modified
- [ ] **Architecture Understanding**: References Full Claudo specifics

### Known Constraints

‚ö†Ô∏è **Agent Spawning Blocker**: From activeContext.md:
- Manager agent inside container cannot call `claudo plan --prompt-file=...`
- This prevents Manager from orchestrating agents as designed
- Test may need to be executed from host context instead

üîÑ **Adaptation Strategy**: If container spawning fails:
1. Document the blocker confirmation
2. Execute test from host if possible
3. Create validation based on available functionality
4. Still demonstrate planning methodology and structure

## Implementation Readiness

The planning phase is complete with:
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive analysis of project context
- ‚úÖ Detailed implementation plan (plan.yaml)
- ‚úÖ Concrete test scenario defined
- ‚úÖ Success criteria established
- ‚úÖ Constraint awareness documented

Ready to proceed with test execution and validation phase.
