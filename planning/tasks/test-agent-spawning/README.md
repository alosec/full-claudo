# Task: Test Agent Spawning Functionality

## Status
- [ ] Not Started
- Created: 2025-09-09
- Priority: High

## Description
Test the agent spawning system to verify that the Planner agent can successfully create and execute tasks within the Full Claudo multi-agent system. This serves as both a functionality test and a validation that the hierarchical planning system is working correctly.

## Requirements
- Verify Planner agent can read memory-bank files for context
- Test task creation following hierarchical structure
- Validate README.md formatting and content standards
- Confirm planning/INDEX.md integration works
- Test the complete planning workflow from analysis to task creation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Planner agent successfully analyzes memory-bank context
- [ ] Task directory created in correct hierarchical location
- [ ] README.md follows proper format with all required sections
- [ ] Planning/INDEX.md is updated to reflect new task
- [ ] Task demonstrates clear understanding of project architecture
- [ ] Task includes actionable implementation steps

## Implementation Steps
1. Step 1: Analyze current memory-bank files for project context
2. Step 2: Understand existing planning structure from planning/INDEX.md
3. Step 3: Create task directory following naming conventions
4. Step 4: Write comprehensive README.md with all required sections
5. Step 5: Update planning/INDEX.md to add new task to active list
6. Step 6: Verify task creation follows hierarchical principles

## Files to Modify
- `planning/tasks/test-agent-spawning/README.md` - Task definition and requirements
- `planning/INDEX.md` - Add new task to active tasks list

## Testing Strategy
- Manual verification of task structure and content
- Validation against existing task examples in planning system
- Confirmation that all acceptance criteria are met

## Context Understanding Validation
This task tests that the Planner agent can:
- Read and understand the Full Claudo project is a multi-agent system (~100 lines TypeScript)
- Recognize the Docker-based architecture with Claude instances in sandboxes
- Understand the current status (custom prompt support implemented, agent spawning next)
- Know the 5 agent types: Manager, Planner, Worker, Critic, Oracle
- Understand the memory-bank serves as project context storage
- Recognize the hierarchical planning system structure
