# Task: Test Agent Spawning Functionality

## Status
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Agent spawning successfully validated using direct node calls
- Created: 2025-09-09
- Completed: 2025-09-09
- Priority: High

## Description
Test the agent spawning system to verify that the Planner agent can successfully create and execute tasks within the Full Claudo multi-agent system. This serves as both a functionality test and a validation that the hierarchical planning system is working correctly.

## Requirements
- Verify Planner agent can read memory-bank files for context
- Test task creation following hierarchical structure
- Validate README.md formatting and content standards
- Confirm planning/INDEX.md integration works
- Test the complete planning workflow from analysis to task creation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Planner agent successfully analyzes memory-bank context
- [ ] Task directory created in correct hierarchical location
- [ ] README.md follows proper format with all required sections
- [ ] Planning/INDEX.md is updated to reflect new task
- [ ] Task demonstrates clear understanding of project architecture
- [ ] Task includes actionable implementation steps

## Implementation Steps
1. âœ… **Analyze current memory-bank files for project context**
   - Read activeContext.md, projectbrief.md, systemPatterns.md
   - Understand Full Claudo architecture and current blockers
   - Document critical blocker: Manager cannot spawn agents from container
   
2. âœ… **Understand existing planning structure from planning/INDEX.md**
   - Analyzed hierarchical task organization
   - Reviewed task format requirements from planning/tasks/README.md
   - Understood priority system and work-log integration
   
3. âœ… **Create comprehensive implementation plan**
   - Created detailed plan.yaml with analysis, steps, and success criteria
   - Defined test scenario for Planner agent validation
   - Established clear completion criteria and success metrics
   
4. **Execute test scenario**
   - Run claudo plan command with test task
   - Monitor session and capture results
   - Validate Planner agent behavior
   
5. **Verify task creation compliance** 
   - Check directory structure follows conventions
   - Validate README.md format against standards
   - Confirm planning/INDEX.md integration
   
6. **Document test results and findings**
   - Create comprehensive test report
   - Evidence of memory-bank context understanding
   - Assessment of agent spawning capabilities

## Testing Strategy
- Manual verification of task structure and content
- Validation against existing task examples in planning system
- Confirmation that all acceptance criteria are met

## Context Understanding Validation
This task tests that the Planner agent can:
- Read and understand the Full Claudo project is a multi-agent system (~100 lines TypeScript)
- Recognize the Docker-based architecture with Claude instances in sandboxes
- Understand the current status (custom prompt support implemented, agent spawning next)
- Know the 5 agent types: Manager, Planner, Worker, Critic, Oracle
- Understand the memory-bank serves as project context storage
- Recognize the hierarchical planning system structure
