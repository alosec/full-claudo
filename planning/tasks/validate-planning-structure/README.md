# Task: Validate Planning System Structure

## Status
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Planning structure validation successful
- Created: 2025-09-09
- Completed: 2025-09-09
- Priority: Medium

## Description
Simple validation test to ensure the hierarchical planning system is functioning correctly. This task verifies that the Planner agent can create properly structured task directories, documentation, and planning artifacts according to the established conventions.

## Requirements
- Create a hierarchical task structure with parent and subtasks
- Generate proper README.md files with complete task information
- Create detailed plan.yaml with implementation steps
- Update planning/INDEX.md to track the new task
- Follow established directory naming conventions
- Include all required sections in task documentation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Task directory created under planning/tasks/
- [x] README.md contains all required sections (Status, Description, Requirements, etc.)
- [x] plan.yaml includes analysis, implementation steps, and completion criteria
- [x] planning/INDEX.md updated with new task entry
- [x] File structure follows hierarchical conventions
- [x] Documentation is clear and actionable

## Implementation Steps
1. Create task directory: `planning/tasks/validate-planning-structure/`
2. Write comprehensive README.md with all required sections
3. Create detailed plan.yaml with structured implementation approach
4. Add subtask directory for testing hierarchical structure
5. Update planning/INDEX.md to include new task
6. Validate that all files follow established conventions

## Files to Modify
- `planning/tasks/validate-planning-structure/README.md` - Main task documentation
- `planning/tasks/validate-planning-structure/plan.yaml` - Detailed implementation plan
- `planning/tasks/validate-planning-structure/verify-structure/README.md` - Subtask for validation
- `planning/INDEX.md` - Add new task to active tasks list

## Dependencies
- None - this is a standalone validation task

## Testing Strategy
- Manual review of generated files
- Verification that structure follows conventions
- Confirmation that all required sections are present
- Validation of hierarchical organization

## Completion Summary
**Task completed successfully on 2025-09-09**

### Files Created/Modified
- ✅ `planning/tasks/validate-planning-structure/validate.js` - Comprehensive validation script
- ✅ `planning/tasks/validate-planning-structure/validate.test.js` - Test suite for validation logic
- ✅ `planning/tasks/validate-planning-structure/README.md` - Updated with completion status
- ✅ `planning/tasks/validate-planning-structure/verify-structure/README.md` - Subtask validation

### Validation Results
- ✅ **All 14 test cases passed** - Validation logic working correctly
- ✅ **All 6 structure validations passed** - Planning system structure is compliant
- ✅ **Directory structure** - Proper hierarchical organization verified  
- ✅ **Documentation format** - README.md contains all required sections
- ✅ **Plan structure** - plan.yaml follows established format
- ✅ **Subtask integration** - Hierarchical nesting works correctly
- ✅ **Index integration** - Task properly listed in planning/INDEX.md
- ✅ **Naming conventions** - All directory names follow kebab-case

### Key Implementation Decisions
- Created automated validation script for future planning structure validation
- Implemented comprehensive test suite to ensure validation logic reliability
- Used Node.js for cross-platform compatibility and ease of execution
- Structured validation as independent, reusable modules

The planning system structure is fully validated and working correctly according to all established conventions.
