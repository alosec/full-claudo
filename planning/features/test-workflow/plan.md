# Test Workflow Implementation Plan

## Overview
Create a simple test feature to validate the multi-agent workflow system. This will serve as a proof-of-concept to ensure all system components work together.

## Implementation Strategy
Since this is a test of the workflow itself, we'll create a simple utility function that demonstrates the full development cycle.

## File Tree Changes

### New Files
```
src/test-utils.ts        # Simple utility functions for testing workflow
tests/test-utils.test.ts # Unit tests for the utility functions
```

### Modifications
```
package.json             # Add test script if not already present
README.md               # Document the test workflow feature (optional)
```

## Detailed Implementation

### 1. src/test-utils.ts
Create a simple utility module with basic functions:
- `greet(name: string): string` - Returns greeting message
- `add(a: number, b: number): number` - Basic arithmetic
- `isEven(n: number): boolean` - Number utility function

### 2. tests/test-utils.test.ts
Add comprehensive unit tests for all utility functions:
- Test greet function with various inputs
- Test add function with positive/negative numbers
- Test isEven function with edge cases

### 3. Package.json Updates (if needed)
Ensure test script exists:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest" // or whatever test runner is configured
  }
}
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All files created with proper TypeScript types
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Code follows existing project conventions
- [ ] No TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] Functions are well-documented with JSDoc comments

## Validation Steps
1. Run TypeScript compiler to ensure no errors
2. Run unit tests to verify functionality
3. Run any existing linter/formatter
4. Verify code follows project patterns

## Time Estimate
- Implementation: 15-20 minutes
- Testing: 10 minutes
- Validation: 5 minutes
- Total: ~30-35 minutes

## Notes
This is intentionally simple to focus on workflow validation rather than complex feature implementation. The goal is to prove that:
1. Plans can be created and executed
2. Code can be implemented following patterns
3. Tests can be written and run
4. Validation processes work
5. Work logging captures the process
