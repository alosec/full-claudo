# Feature Planning Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains strategic feature planning documents for the Full Claudo system. Each feature plan provides comprehensive analysis and design before implementation.

## Feature Plan Format

Create feature plans as `[feature-name].md` with this structure:

```markdown
# Feature: [Feature Name]

## Executive Summary
Brief overview of the feature and its value proposition

## Problem Statement
What problem does this feature solve?

## Proposed Solution
High-level approach to solving the problem

## Technical Design
### Architecture
- Component structure
- Data flow
- Integration points

### Implementation Strategy
- Phase 1: [Initial implementation]
- Phase 2: [Enhancement]
- Phase 3: [Polish and optimization]

## Task Breakdown
Links to specific tasks in ../tasks/ directory:
- [ ] tasks/implement-[feature]/
  - [ ] tasks/implement-[feature]/[subtask-1]/
  - [ ] tasks/implement-[feature]/[subtask-2]/

## Success Metrics
- How do we measure success?
- What are the acceptance criteria?

## Risks and Mitigations
- Risk 1: [Description] → Mitigation: [Approach]
- Risk 2: [Description] → Mitigation: [Approach]

## Timeline Estimate
- Planning: X days
- Implementation: Y days
- Testing: Z days

## Dependencies
- External dependencies
- Internal system requirements
```

## Best Practices

1. **Research First**: Analyze existing codebase before proposing solutions
2. **Break Down Complexity**: Large features should have phased approaches
3. **Link to Tasks**: Always reference specific task directories
4. **Update Regularly**: Keep feature plans current as implementation progresses
5. **Document Decisions**: Record why certain approaches were chosen

## Current Features

_Feature plans will be listed here as they are created_

## Archive

Completed features can be moved to an `archive/` subdirectory for historical reference.
