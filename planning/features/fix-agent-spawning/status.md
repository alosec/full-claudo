# Agent Spawning Fix Status

## Progress Made

âœ… **Path Issues Fixed**: Updated `/workspace/claudo` script with correct paths:
- Docker environment detection: Changed from checking `/usr/local/lib/claudo` to using `/workspace` when `/.dockerenv` exists
- Updated all dist paths to use `dist/src/` subdirectory structure
- Fixed version check to use `$CLAUDO_LIB/package.json`

âœ… **Environment Verified**: 
- Claude CLI is available at `/usr/local/bin/claude` and working correctly
- Prompts exist at `/workspace/prompts/` with all agent types (planner, worker, critic, oracle)
- TypeScript compiled files exist at `/workspace/dist/src/agent.js`
- Made agent.js executable

âœ… **Agent.js Already Fixed**: The `/workspace/dist/src/agent.js` file already had correct prompt path (`/workspace/prompts/${promptFile}.md`)

## Current Issue

ðŸš§ **Agent Execution**: While the path issues are resolved, agents are still not responding properly. The system:
- Starts agent processes without error
- Reads prompts correctly 
- Claude CLI works when tested directly
- Does not capture session IDs or produce output

## Investigation Findings

The claudo script changes were successful:
```bash
# Before: 
if [[ -f "/.dockerenv" ]] && [[ -d "/usr/local/lib/claudo" ]]; then
  CLAUDO_LIB="/usr/local/lib/claudo"

# After:
if [[ -f "/.dockerenv" ]]; then
  CLAUDO_LIB="/workspace"
```

All paths now correctly point to `/workspace/dist/src/` instead of `/usr/local/lib/claudo/dist/`.

## Next Steps Needed

1. **Debug Agent Process**: The agent process appears to hang or not complete execution
2. **Session Capture**: Session ID capture from Claude's verbose output may not be working
3. **Stream Handling**: Input/output streams between agents and Claude CLI need verification

## Files Modified

- `/workspace/claudo` - Fixed Docker path detection and dist paths

## Files Working Correctly

- `/workspace/dist/src/agent.js` - Already had correct prompt paths
- `/workspace/prompts/*.md` - All prompt files exist and readable

## System Status

The fundamental path issues identified in the original inbox item have been resolved. The Manager can now attempt to spawn agents without "module not found" errors. However, there's a secondary issue with agent process execution that requires further investigation.
